Oh, ooh, oh, oh...
There was a time when I
Thought I had no good in me.
There was a time when I
Was too blind to see.

But deep beneath the cold defeat
Under the snow,
You could see something in me
Waiting to grow.

A little seed of what I could be;
How did You know?
You saw my worth, and called it forth
With Your sweet love.

(You are beautiful to me.)
Yes, You are.
(You are beautiful to me.)
You're beautiful, You're beautiful.
Everything that's good in life
You've given to me.
You are beautiful to me.

Maybe it's true that you
Can't see your way forward.
Maybe it's true that you
Can't find your way home. oh...

But deep beneath the cold defeat
Under the snow,
There's a seed of better things
Waiting to grow.

And all it needs to set it free
Is One who can show the way...
Call your name, with heavenly love!

(You are beautiful to me.)
You, yeah.
(You are beautiful to me.)
Oh... ooh...

(Everything that's good in life,)
You've given to me.
You are beautiful to...
(You are beautiful.)
I love to just speak Your name
(You are beautiful.)
In all that You do, ev'ry move that You make
(You are beautiful.)
Don't care what they say!
(Beautiful) to me;
(Beautiful) You're beautiful.
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful...

Yeah... (You are beautiful to me.)
(You are beautiful to me.)
You're beautiful.
(Everything that's good in life,)
You've given to me!
You are... yes You are...
(You are beautiful to me.)
Ev'ry little thing;
Ev'ry little thing, ooh!

(You are beautiful to me.)
I know that I know that I know You're so wonderful!
(Everything that's good in life...)
Everything that You've given to me!
(You are) yes You are (yes You are)...
(You are beautiful to me.)
Oh, yes You are.
(You are beautiful to me, hey.)
(Everything that's good in life
You've given to me.)

[Verse 1]
Tell your boyfriend next time he around
To buy his own weed and don't wear my shit down
I wouldn't care if bre would give me some more
I'd rather him leave you then leave him my 'dro

[Chorus]
When you smoke all my weed man
You got to call the green man
So I can get mine and you get yours

[Verse 2]
Once is enough to make me attack
So bring me a bag and your man can come back
I'll check him at the door make sure he got green
I'm tighter than airport security teams

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I'm my own man so when will you learn
That you got a man but I got to burn
Don't make no difference if I end up alone
I'd rather have myself and smoke my homegrown
It's got me addicted, does more than any dick did

[Outro
Yeah I can get mine and you get yours[x2]

<EOS>

[Intro]
Swinging back and forth
A beautiful thing taking you away
My head is spinning

[Verse 1]
My girl tried to stop me
But I had a taste of you
Unfamiliar surroundings
Left me wanting something new
Physically you ain't my type
But you're one of a kind
So subconsciously on purpose
I left my coat behind

[Chorus]
I can't help it, need to stop it
All that I put myself through
Everyone is so denying
Yeah, it's nice to meet you, too

[Verse 2]
I hate my alcoholic logic
As I write this on the train
Victoria's Secret in my bag
And my thighs ache again
Last night tips into my mind
Through the puddle in my head
I always get what I want
I think I even said

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Although I enjoyed it
I should have tied up my loose ends
But I left my jacket with you
And you know my friends
So maybe you will get my number
Or ask them when I'm ached down
But I may have forgotten you
By the next time I'm in town

[Chorus]

<EOS>

[Verse 1]
Attract me, till it hurts to concentrate
Distract me, stops me doin' work I hate
Just to show him how it feels
I walk past his desk in heels
One leg resting on the chair
From the side he pulls my hair

[Chorus]
Amy, Amy, Amy
Although I've been here before
Amy, Amy, Amy
He's just too hard to ignore
Masculine, you spin a spell
I think you'd wear me well
Amy, Amy, Amy
Where's my moral parallel

[Verse 2]
It takes me, half an hour to write a verse
He makes me imagine it from bad to worse
My weakness for the other sex
Every time his shoulders flex
The way the shirt hangs off his back
My train of thought spins right off track

[Chorus]
Amy, Amy, Amy
Although I've been here before
Amy, Amy, Amy
He's just too hard to ignore
Masculine, he spins a spell, yeah
I think he'd wear me well
Amy, Amy, Amy
So where's my moral parallel

[Verse 3]
His own style, right down to his Diesel jeans
Immobile, I can't think by any means
Underwear peeks out the top
I'll let you know when you should stop
From the picture my mind drew
I know I'd look good on you

[Chorus]
Amy, Amy, Amy
Although I've been here before
Amy, Amy, Amy
You're too hard to ignore
Masculine, you spin a spell
I think you'd wear me well
Amy, Amy, Amy
So where's my moral parallel

[Bridge]
Creative energy abused
All my lyrics go unused
When I clock black hair blue eyes
I drift off, I fantasize

[Chorus]
Amy, Amy, Amy
Although I've been here before
Amy, Amy, Amy
He's just too hard to ignore
Masculine, he spins a spell

[Verse]
I've been so many places in my life and time
I've sung a lot of songs, I've made some bad rhyme
I've acted out my life in stages
With ten thousand people watching
But we're alone now and I'm singing this song for you
I know your image of me is what I hope to be
I've treated you unkindly but can't you see
There's no one more important to me
So darling, won't you please see through me?
Because we're alone now and I'm singing this song for you
You taught me precious secrets of the truth with holding nothing
You came out in front, well baby I was high then
But now I'm so much better with my words coming together
Listen to the melody because my love is in there hiding
I love you in a place where there's no space or time
I love you for my life
Because you the boy next door and a friend of mine
And when my life is over
Remember [x5]
Being together
And I was singing this song for you

[Outro]
We were alone and
And I was singing this song
Singing this song
****
We were all alone
We belong
And I was singing my song for you
We were alone and I was singing our song for you

[Verse 1]
He left no time to regret
Kept his dick wet
With his same old safe bet
Me and my head high
And my tears dry
Get on without my guy
You went back to what you knew
So far removed
From all that we went through
And I tread my troubled track
My odds are stacked
I'll go back to black...

[Chorus]
We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her and I go back to
I go back to us

[Verse 2]
I loved you much;
It's not enough
You love blow
And I love puff
And life, is like a pipe
And I'm a tiny penny rollin'
Up the walls inside

We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her and I go back to

[Verse 1]
I make a name for myself in different ways
All the while you will see my songs of praise
How can I concentrate when all the while my head
Throws me scenarios so I tease myself instead
Though I can talk it through
Really I find it tough
My frustration is relieved but not nearly enough
And added to that I'm sick of having to seek some peace
Because I need emotion with my physical release, yeah

[Chorus] x2
Can't help
But bring it up and beat the point to death
But my
Words are for nothin', I'm wasting my breath

Can't help
But bring it up and beat the point to death
But my words are for nothin', I just keep wasting my breath


[Verse 2]
They're everywhere I go and I always stare
I justify attraction by your hands, or lips, or hair
And so although I always look I know that I can't touch
Uh Because I can only take a full time man so much
And now I've reached a point where I don't care anymore
It's a necessity just like it was before
But these days I ignore the way my body aches
Cause I'm the shit I earn I can't afford mistakes, no
Oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
Can't help
But bring it up and beat the point to death
But my
Words are for nothin', I'm wasting my breath

Can't help
But bring it up and beat the point to death
But my words are for nothin', I just keep wasting my breath
(My words are)
No, no

[ENDING]
Can't help
I can't help but bring it up, no

But my
My

Can't help
Ah I can't help, oh no
But my words are for nothin', I just keep wasting my breath
(My words are runnin' me)
Yeah, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
Can't help
But bring it up and beat the point to death
But my
Words are for nothin', I'm wasting my breath

Can't help
But bring it up and beat the point to death
But my words are for nothin', I just keep wasting my breath

Can't help
But my
Can't help
But my words are for nothin', I just keep wasting my breath

[Verse 1]
I can't wait to get away from you
And surprisingly you hate me too
We only communicate when we need to fight
But we are best friends, right?
You are too good at pretending you don't care
There's enough resentment in the air
Now you don't want me in the flat
When you are home at night
But we're best friends right?

You are Stephanie and I'm Paulette
You know what all my faces mean
And it's easy to smoke it up, forget
Everything that happened in between

So I don't want to tell you anything
I can't even think about

You're always looking for someone to blame
Now you want me to suffer just cause
You was born wide
But we are best friends right?

So I had love for you when I was 4
And there's no one I wanna smoke with more

I would die before I divorce ya
I'd take a thousand thumps for my love
Cause you kissed a lucky horseshoe
Stuck it in my boxing glove
Does anyone who will listen up
To our victories and dumb defeats
Knows they all take you to the cleaners
If you come between the cheats

[Chorus]
Between the cheats
Between the cheats
Between the cheats

[Verse 2]
My husband is the finest handsome hustler
And he still makes this housewife blush
So I go with him, my hand flicks
I'm sitting on the royal flush
Women drink him in, swim in him with green eyes
Then go home and cash the chips you've got
And here maybe two, oh two bottles of
The jack of hearts is my jackpot

[Chorus]

Cause we all have to lock eyes
And I know is my heart beat
There's a winning secret to both
And it's sworn between the cheats

I walk along the street of sorrow
The boulevard of broken dreams
Where gigolo and gigolette
Can take a kiss without regret
So they forget their broken dreams

You laugh tonight and cry tomorrow
When you behold your shattered dreams
And gigolo and gigolette
Awake to find their eyes are wet
With tears that tell of broken dreams

Here is where you'll always find me
Always walking up and down
But I left my soul behind me
In an old cathedral town

The joy you find here, you borrow
You cannot keep it long, it seems
But gigolo and gigolette
Still sing a song and dance along
The boulevard of broken dreams

~Interlude~

Here is where you'll always find me
Always walking up and down
But I left my soul behind me

Still sing a song and dance along
The boulevard of broken dreams

Brother
It's so much that I could never say to your face
But by now
You should know the world and all its ways
So find your place

How do I find words that do not condescend
When she bore you before me
Cause she doesn't need a child she needs a friend
A son, not a sob story, ooh

(Now you look out for her the way she did for you)
And your priority it must be heard
(Now you look out for her the way she did for you)
Cause we'll never be the way we were, oh

She can't always be there just to hold you down
Our mother
When you are at a age now, well life turns around
My brother

Realize that you don't have to answer to no man
Responsibility comes down to you
But how can I expect you to understand
When you live life like it's so run-through
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, hoo

(Now you look out for her the way she did for you)
And your priority, it must be heard
(Now you look out for her the way she did for you)
Cause we'll never be the way we were

The way we were
We'll never be
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
At your priority, it must be her
Ooh, ooh, hoo

[Verse 1 - Amy Winehouse]
Her name is Cherry
We've just met
But already she knows me better than you
She understands me
After eighteen years
And you still don't see me like you ought to do

[Verse 2 - Amy Winehouse]
Maybe we could talk 'bout things
If you was made of wood and strings
While I love her every sound
I dunno how to turn you down
You're so thick and my patience thin
So I got me a new best friend
With a pickup that puts you to shame
And Cherry is her name

[Verse 3 - Amy Winehouse]
And when I'm lonely
Cherry's there
And she plays along while I sing out my blues
I could be crying
And you don't care
You won't call me back, you're stubborn as mule
Maybe we could talk 'bout things
If you was made of wood and strings
You might think I've gone too far
I'm talking 'bout my new guitar

[Verse 1]
Only paid attention in your lessons
I Sat close at the front so I could see
Your enthusiastic demonstrations
Teaching to a class of only me
And I couldn?t speak directly to you
Without stuttering or turning red
So looking back I don't know how I handled it, yeah
Futile frustration in my head

[Chorus]
I can't help but analyze your actions
Neglecting mine
Before I know I've fallen hard
And now I tread water in time

[Verse 2]
Hated it when I saw them together
I sat around waiting for shit to end
Unconsciously I tried to sabotage it
To get revenge on my best friend
Because I was in love with him before her
I had just cause to grieve
So not long after she broke up with him
I got my closure on new years eve

[Chorus][x2]

[Verse 3]
I love all the bickering and insults
And when I shout at you and you smile
Making coffee while my mind spills over
How I catch your art once in a while
Shouldn?t I have grown a little wiser?
Why haven't I learned my lesson yet?
And although I have made my love progresses
I tend to learn as much as I forget

[Chorus][x3]

<EOS>

[Chorus]
Cupid
Draw back your bow
And let your arrow flow
Straight to my lover's heart
For me, nobody but me

You better
Please hear my cry
And let your arrow fly
Straight to my lover's heart
For me

[Verse 1]
I don't want to bother you
But I'm in distress
There's danger of me losing
All my happiness
For, I love a man
Who doesn't know I exist
And this you can fix, so

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Now, if your arrow makes
His love strong for me
I swear I'm going to love him
'til eternity
I know that 'tween the both of us
His heart we can steal
Cupid, help me if you will

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Yeah yeah yeah cupid
Oh oh cupid
I love him love him

<EOS>

[Verse]
I did it, it's finished, it's over and done
Now I'm gonna sit back, don't wait for the fun
Like a finger to the strings
You'd wail if I said these things
Have to lay awake guilty once you sleep
Or would you take me in your arms and weep?
I'm culpable for your scornful ways
And I can still taste better days
Now maybe it is for the best
But I've lost interest
I did, it's finished, it's over and done
Now I'm gonna back, don't wait for the fun

<EOS>

[Verse 1]
Do me good
Got back together with my man last night
But I think I was dreaming he didn't feel quite right
I pressed his chest under my fingertips
Beside myself I sighed and reminded of his lips

[Hook]
I'm confused and quizzical
Funny once you know
I just wan get physical
Let me tell ya how

[Chorus]
Do me good I'll tell you anything you want to hear
Do me good do me good do me good do me good
Do me good and all this craziness will disappear
Do me good do me good do me good do me good
(We out)

[Verse 2]
Its like he was designed with me in mind
Hes so good from behind
Hes beautifully defined
I miss him most of all when it got late
Attempt to hear him breathing
Or feel his shifting weight

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus] [x4]

<EOS>

Girls you know you betta watch out
Some guys, some guys are only about
That thing, that thing, that thing
That thing, that thing, that thing
Girls you know you betta watch out
Some girls, some girls are only about
That thing, that thing, that thing
That thing, that thing, that thing
Girls you know you betta watch out
Some girls, some girls are only about
That thing, that thing, that thing
That thing, that thing, that thing

When you walk in the bar
And you dressed like a star
Rockin' your "f me pumps"
And the men notice you
With your Gucci bag crew
Can't tell who he's lookin' to
Cause you all look the same
Everyone knows your name
And that's you whole claim to fame
Never miss a night
Cause your dream in life
Is to be a footballer's wife
You don't like players
That's what you say-a
But you really wouldn't mind a millionaire
You don't like ballers
They don't do nothing for ya
But you'd love a rich man six foot two or taller
You're more than a fan
Lookin' for a man
But you end up with one-night-stands
He could be your whole life
If you got past one night
But that part never goes right
In the morning you're vexed
He's onto the next
And you didn't even get no taste
Don't be too upset
If they call you a skank
Cause like the news everyday you get pressed
You don't like players
That's what you say-a
But you really wouldn't mind a millionaire
Or them big baller
Don't do nothing for ya
But you'd love a rich man six foot two or taller
You can't sit down right
Cause you jeans are too tight
And your lucky its ladies night
With your big empty purse
Every week it gets worse
At least your breasts cost more than hers
So you did Miami
Cause you got there for free
But somehow you missed the plane
You did too much (bleep)
Met somebody
And spent the night getting cane
Without girls like you
There'd be no fun
We'd go to the club and not see anyone
Without girls like you
There's no nightlife
All those men just go home to their wives
Don't be mad at me
Cause you're pushing thirty
And your old tricks no longer work
You should have known from the jump
That you always get dumped
So dust off your "f me pumps"

<EOS>

[Verse 1]
She sits home and dreams
That her man will leave his mark on her hand
He's not all he seems
But she's seen a dress, she has the flowers planned

Now she won't be happy
Till she looks down and sees the engagement ring
It's for security
Cause she will be waiting years for her wedding

[Chorus]
For me it ain't real, it's fools gold
There too many fools sold, not an excuse, oh
For me it ain't real, it's fools gold
I don't hear everything I'm told

[Verse 2]
He won't change her life
He just chasing tail and wasting her time
She calls herself his wife

He calls her at 8 and says be here by 9
She don't notice how when she gets the ring it's not a good fit
So next time that they row she throws it out
It goes to the last girl he hit

[Chorus]
For me it ain't real, it's fools gold
There too many fools sold, not an excuse, oh
For me it ain't real, it's fools gold
I don't hear everything I'm told

[Verse 3]
So take the gold you find
And for your own sake hold it in your hand
Now make sure you bite down
And watch your tooth don't break on that wedding band

[Chorus]
For me it ain't real, it's fools gold
There too many fools sold, not an excuse, oh oh
For me it ain't real, it's fools gold

Fools gold, ooohh ooohhh
Fools gold, ooohh ooohhh

Fools gold, fools gold

[Verse 1]
When you walk in the bar
And you’re dressed like a star
Rocking your F-Me-Pumps
And a man notice you
With your Gucci bag crew
Can’t tell who he’s looking to
Cause you all look the same
Everyone knows your name
And that’s your whole claim to fame
Never miss a night
Cause your dream in life
Is to be a foot-baller’s wife

You don’t like play-ers

But you really wouldn't mind a million-aire
You don’t like ball-ers

[Verse 3]
You can’t sit down right
Because your jeans are too tight
And you lucky it’s ladies' night
With your big empty purse

At least your breast cost more than hers
So you did Mi-am-i
Cause you got there for free
But somehow you missed the plane
You did too much E
Met some-bod-y
And spent the night getting caned
Without girls like you there’d be no fun
We’d go to the club and not see any-one
Without girls like you there’s no night life
All those men just go home to their wives
Don’t be mad at me
Cause your pushing 30
And your old tricks no longer work
You should have known from the jump

[Verse 1]
Simple, sweet guitar
Humbled by the bass
So when the beat kicks in
Everything falls into place
And it overpowers me
I can’t help but dance
You can try to stop me now
But you won’t get the chance

[Chorus]
Halftime, time to think it through
Consider the change
Seek it from a different view
Halftime, time to think it through
Consider the change

[Verse 2]
Rhythm floods my heart
The melody it feeds my soul
The tune tears me apart
And I swallow it whole
You should thank your lucky star
Cause the music is a gift
And it’s stronger than all else
Provides me with the bliss

[Chorus]
Halftime, time to think it through
Consider the change
Seek it from a different view
Halftime, time to think it through
Consider the change

[Verse 3]
My lyrics revealing
Some natural vibe
It's a kind of laid back feeling
Oh just let it ride
And when Frank Sinatra sings
It’s too much to take, yeah
So I sing the standard shit
It pacifies my ache

[Chorus]
Halftime, time to think it through
Consider the change
Seek it from a different view
Halftime, time to think it through
Consider the change

[Verse]
He can only hold her for so long
The lights are on but no one's home
She's so vacant her soul is taken
He thinks "What's she running from?
Now how can he have her heart
When it got stole?
So he tries to pacify her
Because what's inside her never dies
Even if she's content in his warmth
She is plagued with urgency
Searching kisses
The man she misses
The man that he longs to be
Now how can he have her heart
When it got stole?
So he tries to pacify her
Because what's inside her never dies
So he tries to pacify her
Because what's inside her, it never dies

[Outro]
So he tries to pacify her
But what's inside her never dies

<EOS>

He can only hold her for so long
The lights are on but no one's home
She's so vacant, her soul is taken
He thinks what's he running from
Now how can he have her heart
When it got stole
So he tries to pacify her
'Cause what's inside her never dies
Even if she's content in his warmth
She is plagued with urgency
Searching kisses, the man she misses
The man that he longs to be
Now how can he have her heart
When it got stole
So he tries to pacify her
'Cause what's inside her never dies
So he tries to pacify her
'Cause what's inside her, it never dies
So he tries to pacify her
'Cause what's inside her never dies

[Verse 1]
When I walk in your shoes
I understand a man confused
They much too big, but i don't care
Feel the weight your shoulders bear
Now I really empathize
Looking through your bloodshot eyes
And I know you, you're so frustrated
But we all become what we once hated
Besides nobody can be that wise

[Chorus]
I can't help you if you won't help yourself
I can't help you if you won't help yourself
You can only get so much from someone else (you can only get so much from me)
I can't help you if you won't help yourself

[Verse 2]
You got a degree in philosophy
So you  think you cleverer than me (cause you so smart)
But I'm not just some drama queen
Cause its where you're at, not where you've been
So what do you expect from me (what do you want)
To hold your head above the sea (keep you high and dry)
And carry you, even though you bigger
Cause don't you know you crush my tiny figure
And anyway, we still so young (yeah, I'm so young)
And this isn't yesterday

[Chorus]
I can't help you if you won't help yourself
I can't help you if you won't help yourself
You can only get so much from someone else (you can only get so much from me)
I can't help you if you won't help yourself


[Verse 3]
You might be twenty-five but in my mind
I see you at sixteen years old most of the time
And I, I'm just a child and you're full grown
And it was like nothing that I've ever known
You are like nothing that I ever knew

<EOS>

[Intro]
I bought you a fur coat when you were fifteen
You wore it to the disco when everyone was in jeans

[Chorus]
But you were just a rich girl and only having fun
Your worn-out dresses drew stares from everyone
Hey, little rich girl where did you go wrong?

[Verse 1]
You left for London when you were nineteen
Had to pawn all your nice clothes, just living on dreams
A man in the bright lights took all that you own
Now he's taken your freedom for a taste unknown

[Chorus]
But you were just a rich girl and only having fun
Your worn-out dresses drew stares from everyone
Hey, little rich girl where did you go wrong?


[Verse 2]
Hey, little rich girl you've been away for so long
And now little rich girl, I wrote you in this song
Hey, little rich girl, baby, love is gone
And now little rich girl, I know where you belong
At your dad's office party all the movies were blue
Caused him so much heartache because the screen star was you
You left for London when you were nineteen
Had to pawn all your nice clothes just living on a dream

[Chorus]
But you were just a rich girl and only having fun
Your worn-out dresses drew stares from everyone
Hey, little rich girl where did you go wrong?

<EOS>

(feat. Paul Weller)
I bet you wonderin'
How I knew
'Bout your plans
To make me blue
With some other guy
You knew before
Between two of us guys
You know I love you more
It took me by surprise
I must say
When I found you yesterday
Don't you know that
I heard it
Through the grapevine
Not much longer
Would you be mine
Uhh, uhh
Heard it through
The grapevine
Oh
I'm just about
To lose my mind
Honey, honey
Oh, baby
Ooh ooh honey honey
I know a man
Ain't supposed to cry
But these tears
I can't hold inside
Losin' you
Would end my life
You see
Cause you mean
That much to me
You could have
Told me yourself
That you loved
Someone else
Instead
I heard it
Through the grapevine
Not much longer
Would you be mine
Ohh
I heard it
Through the grapevine
And I'm just
About to lose my mind
Honey, honey
People say believe
Half of what you see
Oh, and none
Of what your hear
But I can't help
But be confused
If it's true
Please tell me dear
Do you plan
To let me go
For the other guy
You loved before?

<EOS>

[Verse]
I couldn't resist him
His eyes were like yours
His hair was exactly your shade of brown
He's just not as tall
But I couldn't tell
It was dark and I was lying down

You are everything
He means nothing to me
I can't even remember his name
Why're you so upset?
Baby, you weren't there
And I was thinking of you when I came

What do you expect?
You left me here alone
I drank so much and needed your touch
Don't overreact
I pretended he was you
You wouldn't want me to be lonely

How can I put it so you understand?
I didn't let him hold my hand
But he looked like you
I guess he looked like you
No he wasn't you
But you can still trust me
This ain't infidelity
It's not cheating
You were on my mind

[Outro]
Yes he looked like you
But I heard love is blind

<EOS>

I couldn't resist him
His eyes were like yours

He means nothing to me
I can't even remember his name
Why're you so upset?
Baby, you weren't there
And I was thinking of you when I came
What do you expect?
You left me here alone
I drank so much and needed to touch
Don't overreact
I pretended he was you
You wouldn't want me to be lonely
How can I put it so you understand?
I didn't let him hold my hand
But he looked like you
I guess he looked like you
No, he wasn't you
But you can still trust me
This ain't infidelity
It's not cheating
Oh, you were on my mind
Yes, he looked like you
But I heard love is blind

<EOS>

I couldn't resist him, his eyes were like yours
His hair was exactly the shade of brown
He's just not as tall, but I couldn't tell

You are everything, he means nothing to me
I can't even remember his name
Why're you so upset?
Baby, you weren't there and I was thinking of you when I came

What do you expect? You left me here alone
I drank so much and needed to touch
Don't overreact, I pretended he was you

It's not cheating, you were on my mind
Yes, he looked like you
But I heard love is blind

<EOS>

If I ever leave you, baby
You can say I told you so
And if I ever hurt you
I hurt myself as well

Now is that any way for a man to carry on
Do you think, I want my loved one gone
Said I love you
More than you'll ever know
More than you'll ever know

When I wasn't making too much money
You know where my paycheck went
I brought it home to ya baby
I never spent a red cent

Now, is that any way for a man to carry on
Do you think I want my loved one gone
Said I love you
More than you'll ever know
More than you'll ever know

I'm not trying to be
Just any kind of man
I'm just trying to be somebody
You can love, trust and understand
I know, I know, I know, I can be
The part of you that no one else could see

But I got to hear ya say
I got to hear ya say
It's alright

I'm only flesh and blood
But I can be anything that you demand
I can be king of everything
Or just a tiny grain of sand

Now, is that anyway for a man to carry on
Do you think that I wants my loved one gone
Said I love you more than you'll ever know
I don't want nobody else
I don't need nobody else
I love you more than you'll ever know

[Verse 1]
Wish I could say it breaks my heart
Like you did in the beginning
It's not that we grew apart
A nightingale no longer singing
Its something I know you can't do
Separate sex with emotion
I sleep alone, the sun comes up
Your still clinging to that notion

[Pre-Chorus]
Every thing is slowing down
River of no return
Recognise my every sound
There is nothing new to learn

[Chorus]
You'll never get my mind right
Like 2 ships passing in the night
In the night, in the night
Want the same thing where we lay
Otherwise mines a different way
A different way from where I'm going
Oh, its you again listen this isn't a reunion
So sorry if I turn my head
Yours is a familiar face
But that don't make your place safe
In my bed my bed my bed

[Verse 2]
I never thought my memory
Of what we had could be intruded
But I couldn't let it be
I needed it as much as you did
Now its not hard to understand
Why we just speak at night
The only time I hold your hand
Is to get the angle right

[Pre-Chorus]
Every thing is slowing down
River of no return
Recognise my every sound
There is nothing new to learn

In the night, in the night
Want the same thing where we lay
Otherwise mines a different way
A different way from where I'm going
Oh, its you again listen this isn't a reunion

A nightingale no longer singing

It's something I know you can't do
Separate sex with emotion
I sleep alone, the sun comes up
You're still clinging to that notion

Everything is slowing down
River of no return
Recognize my every sound
There's nothing new to learn

You'll never get my mind right
Like two ships passing in the night
In the night, in the night

Want the same thing when we lay
Otherwise mine's a different way
A different way from where I'm going

Oh, it's you again
Listen this isn't a reunion
So sorry if I turn my head

Yours is a familiar face
But that don't make your place safe
In my bed, my bed, my bed

I never thought my memory
Of what we had could be intruded
But I couldn't let it be
I needed it as much as you did

Now it's not hard to understand
Why we just speak at night
The only time I hold your hand
Is to get the angle right

Everything is slowing down
River of no return
You recognise my every sound
There's nothing new to learn

You'll never get my mind right
Like two ships passing in the night
In the night, in the night

Want the same thing where we lay
Otherwise mine's a different way
It's a different way from where I'm going

Oh, it's you again
Listen this isn't a reunion
So sorry if I turn my head

Yours is a familiar face
But that don't make your place safe
In my bed, my bed, my ba ba dee dee bed

Wish I could say it breaks my heart
Like you did in the beginning
Its not that we grew apart

Your still clinging to that notion
Every thing is slowing down

[Intro: Scat]

[Verse 1]
You should be stronger than me
You been here 7 years longer than me
Don't you know you supposed to be the man
Not pale in comparison to who you think I am
You always wanna talk it through - I don't care!
I always have to comfort you when I'm there
But that's what I need you to do - stroke my hair!

[Chorus]
Cause' I've forgotten all of young love's joy
Feel like a lady, and you my lady boy

[Verse 2]
You should be stronger than me
But instead you're longer than frozen turkey
Why'd you always put me in control?
All I need is for my man to live up to his role
Always wanna talk it through - I'm OK
Always have to comfort you every day
But that's what I need you to do - are you gay?

[Chorus]
Cause' I've forgotten all of young love's joy
Feel like a lady, and you my lady boy

[Verse 3]
He said "the respect I made you earn
Thought you had so many lessons to learnt"
I said "You don't know what love is - get a grip!"
Sounds as if you're reading from some other tired script
I'm not gonna meet your mother anytime
I just wanna grip your body over mine
Please tell me why you think that's a crime

[Chorus]
I've forgotten all of young love's joy
Feel like a lady, and you my lady boy

[Outro]
You should be stronger than me
You should be stronger than me
You should be stronger than me
You should be stronger than me

I saw mommy kissing Santa Claus
Underneath the mistletoe last night
She didn't hear me creep
Down the stairs to have a peep
She thought that I was tucked up
In my bedroom fast asleep
Then I saw mommy tickle Santa Claus
Underneath his snowy beard so white
Oh, what a laugh it would have been
If Daddy had only seen
Mommy kissing Santa Claus last night
Then I saw mommy tickle Santa Claus
Underneath his beard so snowy white
Oh, what a laugh it would have been
If Daddy had only seen
Mommy kissing Santa Claus last night
Oh, my Mommy kissing Santa Claus last night
Oh, my Mommy kissing Santa Claus last night

I should care, I should go around weeping
I should care, I should go without sleeping
Strangely enough, I sleep well
'cept for a dream or two
But then I count my sheep well
Funny how sheep can lull you to sleep
So I should care, I should let it upset me
I should care but it just doesn't get me
Maybe I won't find someone as lovely as you
But I should care and I do
(brief instrumental interlude)
I should care but it just doesn't get me
Maybe I won't find someone as lovely as you
But I should care and I do
And I do

[Verse 1]
When will we get the time to be just friends
It's never safe for us not even in the evening
'Cos I've been drinking
Not in the morning where your shit works
It's always dangerous when everybody's sleeping
And I've been thinking
Can we be alone?
Can we be alone?

[Chorus]
When will we get the time to be just friends
When will we get the time to be just friends

[Verse 2]
And no I'm not ashamed but the guilt will kill you
If she don't first
I'll never love you like her
Though we need to find the time
To just do this shit together
'Fore it gets worse
I wanna touch you
But that just hurts

[Outro/Chorus]
When will we get the time to be just just friends
When will we get the time to be just friends, just friends
When will we get the time to be just friends, just friends
When will we get the time to be just friends, just friends
Just friends

[Verse 1]
You're just a little boy underneath that hat
You need your nerve to hide your ego - don't come with that
You think everything is handed to you free
But it's not that easy, no

[Chorus]
I gotta know you now
We may never meet again
I gotta know you now and then

[Verse 2]
My girl says I'm too sensitive to ride with you
But I'm not listening to her, mm hm
Yes I'm perceptive so when I'm done with you
You'll whisk your head back the way it were
As you were

[Chorus]
I gotta know you now
We may never meet again
I gotta know you now and then

[Ad lib]
Oh, I'm not ruling you out, I'm just in doubt
As to what you say you're all about, yeah

[Chorus]
I gotta know you now
We may never meet again
I gotta show you now and them
I gotta know you now and then

[Outro/Chorus][x4]
I got to know you now
We may never meet again

[Chorus]
I never wanted you to be my man
I just needed company
Don't want to get dependent on
Your time or who you spend it on
I lose it when you love me
Like smoke, I hung around in the unbalanced
Woah, ohh

[Verse 1: Nas]
It’s not a movie, this is not a script to proofread
I’ll spit some untruths to dumb fools and groupies
Fun to punctuate, pronounciate the funds I make
The miles I take put in your face
Oh my mistake, you’re not a floozy
Then excuse me
Before I talk, my style introduced me
Get your name and phone number like 1-2-3
Y’all know the story, y’all know the commentary
I kick the narrative, this is legendary
The good Samaritan, hood thespian
Like a polygamist, with a twist
Will I marry again? Maybe, I guess
I hold a lady’s interest, I just met
The love scholar, she’s the teacher’s pet
Every other eve we meet and make each other sweat
I feel triumphant, no strings
Just a fling to have fun with
I be out in London, Camden
Huntin’ for the answers, why did God take away the homie?
I can’t stand it
I’m a firm believer that we all meet up in eternity
Just hope the big man show me some courtesy
Why? ‘Cause I’m deemed a heart breaker
Like smoke, girls linger ‘round a player

[Chorus]
I never wanted you to be my man
I just needed company
Don't want to get dependent on
Your time or who you spend it on
I lose it when you love me
Like smoke, I hung around in the unbalanced
Woah, ohh

[Verse 2: Nas]
Yo, this recession is a test
It’s affecting my complexion
Misdirectin' my affection
My concerns are bill collections
The facts is the taxes, they after me
Chapter three, my property
My handlers, they dealt with me improperly
I say some things I should probably keep privately
Evaluate the world bank trusts like I’m IEG
Those fly suites and my bourgeoisie
Tall freak, she wouldn’t protest with me at Wall Street
She says, no you’re so deep
I said, no let’s go through it
Historically so ruthless as feds came for Joe Louis
She said, my man you need to laugh sometimes
Classifies me as a bore, I tell her have some wine
You colder than penguin pussy, in her dismay
She’s thinkin’ that’s just so silly to say
But if you really think about it hussy
See a penguin, he drags his ass on the ground all day
And it’s a dragon, it’s a bastard you’re in tune with, just lust
I’m through with you after my crush
So is that humorous enough?
The smoke I puff
Tell the car to go to Aura, Funky Buddah, Whisky Mist on Mayfair
I hope I meet Monie Love so she can show me love
NYC to UK I might stay there
Everybody in the club tonight say, “Yeah”
You know how me and Amy are, straight players

[Outro]
Ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh

Ooohhh
Yyyaaahhh [x4]

I never wanted you to be my man
I  just wanted to see what you do
Yay… no
Yoouuu.yooouuu.yahh

Heeeyyy

I feel it in my heart
When you ?
I never wanted you many times when i try to set you right
It’s just too hard
I never wanted you to be my man, but I really couldn’t control myself

[Verse 1]
Running down my batteries
Laying me out to rest
Knowing when that in
Five hours
I'll wake up and de-stress
And I'm digging myself into a hole
And these days I just work
When once I had so much soul

[Chorus]
And lately I've forgotten who I am
Need to let my energy just drain away
And now - my mind - is working overtime
It's been a long day
Such a long day

[Verse 2]
And while all my contemporaries
(All my friends, yeah)
Are sitting in college now
My education is dragging, dragging
My guitar through London town
And the thing that wakes me when
I could sleep instead
Is the thought that tonight
I can fall back into bed

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Recently my head
It isn't recharged as such
And sleep can only cure, yeah
A restless mind so much

Oh, lullaby by birdland that's what i
Always hear, when you sigh
Never in my wordland could there be words to reveal
In a phrase how i feel
Have you ever heard two turtle doves
Bill and coo, when they love?
That's the kind of magic music we made with our lips
When we kiss
And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how i'd cry in my pillow
If you should tell me farewell and goodbye
Lullaby by birdland whisper low
Kiss me sweet, and we'll go
Flying high in birdland, high in the sky up above
All because we're in love
Lullaby, lullaby
Have you ever heard two turtle doves
Bill and coo when they love?
That's the kind of magic music we made with our lips
When we kiss
And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how i'd cry in my pillow
If you should tell me farewell and goodbye
Lullaby by birdland whisper low
Kiss me sweet, and we'll go
Flying high in birdland, high in the sky up above
All because we're in love

It's always gone within two days
Follow my father, his extravagant ways
So if I got it I will spend it all
Camden and Parkway 'til I hit a wall
I cross my fingers at the cash machine
As I check my balance I kiss the screen
I love it when it says I got the means
To go to Miss Sixty and pick up my new jeans

Never lasts me long
Handle finance wrong
Blow it all on bags and shoes
Jazz 'n blues
Never lasts me long
Handle finance wrong
Blow it all on bags and shoes

Standin' too deep at the bar today
Wait with impatience to throw my cash away
Four white Russians a JD and Coke
Buy their drinks all night and now I am broke
But that's cool 'cause I can borrow more from you
And I didn't forget about that fifty pound, too
Tell you what, my advance is comin' through
I'll take you out shoppin'
Can you wait 'til next June? Yeah

Never lasts me long
Handle finance wrong (handle it wrong)
Blow it all on bags and shoes

Never lasts me long (long)
Handle finance wrong (wrong)
Blow it all on bags and shoes (blow it all)

There I go, there I go, there I go, there I go
Pretty baby you are the soul, snaps my control
Such a funny thing but every time you're near me
I never can behave
You give me a smile and I'm wrapped up in your magic
There's music all around me
Crazy music, music that keeps calling me so
Very close to you, turns me into your slave
Come on and do with me any little thing that you want to
Anything, baby just let me get next to you

So am I insane or do I really see heaven in your eyes?
Bright as stars that shine up above you
In the clear blue sky, how I worry 'bout you
Just can't live my life without you
Baby come here, don't have no fear
Oh, is there wonder why
I'm really feeling in the mood for love

So tell me why, stop to think about this weather, my dear
This little dream might fade away
There I go talking out of my head again
Baby won't you come and put our two hearts together
That would make me strong and brave
Oh, when we are one, I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid

If there's a cloud up above us
Go on and let in rain
I'm sure our love together would endure a hurricane
Oh my baby won't you please let me love you
And get a release from this awful misery

What is all this talk about loving me, my sweet
I am not afraid, not anymore
Not like before, can't you understand me
Don't you understand me, now baby please
Pull yourself together, do it very soon
My soul's on fire, come on and take
I'll be what you make me, my darling, my sweet

Oh baby, you make me feel so good
Let me take you by the hand
Come let us visit out there
In that new promised land

Maybe there we can find
A good place to keep a lovin' state of mind

Every day I see you
My hands were made for you
And you always give me stress free point of view
Pick you up after school

Mister Magic, take a token
Mister Magic, of my love
Mister Magic, I see you through the smoke

Without you I'm misery
Blue without my green
All the songs sound better when you're next to me
Yeah, cause you come naturally

Mister Magic, take a token
Mister Magic, of my love, love, love
Mister Magic, I see you through the smoke

Laying on my bed
I reach over for you
And you so fresh you even make the standards new
Burn the tip to get you through

Mister Magic, take a token
Mister Magic, of my love
Mister Magic, I see you through the smoke

I've never been in love before
Such a foolish thing to be
Seems to me the price is high
So I’ll keep my own company
And I’ll do what I want
When I feel

Watch them fall so easily
Temporary insanity
Some say that true love is blind
Me I like to clarify
While I
I just take
My own time
And I

I’ll go my own way
I walk when I wanna
Talk talk when I wanna
Finding my own way
I walk when I wanna talk talk
When I wanna

Seems to be illogical
Love that’s unconditional
Give your heart to someone else
But save a little for your self
That’s why I’m
I’m taking my own time
And I

I’ll go my own way
I walk when I wanna
Talk talk when I wanna
Finding my own way
I walk when I wanna
Talk talk when I wanna

Don’t get me wrong
It’s kinda cynical
But it scares though
So I’m careful with my heart
It’s the only one I got
I cannot
Commit to that shit

I'll talk when I wanna
Finding my own way
I walk when I wanna
Talk talk when I wanna
I’ll go my own way
And I’ll walk when I wanna and tell you
When I wanna
My own way my own way
When I wanna when I wanna

[Verse 1]
Today my bird flew away
Gone to find her big blue jay
Starlight before she took flight
I sung a lullaby of birdland every night
I sang a lullaby every night
Sang for my Ava every night

[Pre-Chorus]
Ava was the morning, now she's gone
She's reborn like Sarah Vaughan
In the sanctuary she has found
Birds surround her sweet sound

[Chorus]
And Ava flies in paradise
And Ava flies in paradise

[Verse 2]
With dread I woke in my bed
To shooting pains up in my head
Lovebird, my beautiful bird
Spoke until one day she couldn't be heard
She spoke until one day she couldn't be heard
She just stopped singing

[Pre-Chorus]
Ava was the morning, now she's gone
She's reborn like Sarah Vaughan
In the sanctuary she has found
Birds surround her sweet sound

[Chorus]
And Ava flies in paradise
And Ava flies in paradise

[Pre-Chorus]
Ava was the morning, now she's gone
She's reborn like Sarah Vaughan
In the sanctuary she has found
Birds surround her sweet sound

[Chorus]
And Ava flies in paradise
And Ava flies in paradise

[Outro/Scat]
She flies in paradise

Thank you, thank you, thank you
Hope you've enjoyed your time at Amy Winehouse's show
Feel free to come back whenever you like
But for now, you can exit on the left on the rail
Take your time and slowly, but quickly, get out

<EOS>

[Verse 1]
I don't catch your drift and I don't catch your plan
Need to get my thoughts down but it's getting late
Need to get up now, get my feet on the ground
But the show is so unprepared now

My place so messed up, I tried on some shoes
Should think clear and focus but I've things to do
Glancing at my CD rack, eyes linger on Frank
And I must put that check in the bank

[Chorus]
Try to put me in a room, distraction less
(Everything is everything)
Spare me from worse
In the studio I will finally burn
(All the time is all you got)
Tempted to work

Always got something to do, someone to be seeing
Somewhere to be dancing, I'm a wake human being
It's an opportunity, shout till you go blue
Unless I wanna do it, your words go through

Need to buy some cigarettes, can't put it off any longer
Worked appeal depression, I feel it growing stronger
Maybe when I'm all grown up, I will get it through
But right now I got stuff to do

[Chorus] x2

Gotta get this song down before I leave tonight
But my hair, just does it's own thing and I gotta look alright
And I gotta write a chorus but words allude me now
I have to get this down before I leave somehow

And anyway I be thinkin' to meet you at the station
Guilty 'cause I should be home, damn procrastination
So when they ask me later, I won't tell them how it's going
But now my head is empty and the work load keeps on growing

[Chorus] x2

[Chorus]
They tried to make me go to rehab but I said no no no

I ain't got the time and if my daddy thinks I'm fine
He's tried to make me go to rehab but I won't go go go

[Verse 1]
I'd rather be at home with Ray
I ain't got seventy days

This me "Yeah, baby, and the rest"

Where's a therapist? Yeah, I'm outta control
They tryna make me go to rehab, I won't go, no
And so I'm addicted, I'm Britney, Whitney, and Bobby
Betty Ford ain't ready for us, ain't nothing can stop me
Oh look he's collapsing, just look how he's rapping
Everytime I try to get out it pulls me back in
Amy should have rehabed him,'stead she doubled his ration
Can you blame me for being a slave to my passion?
My heroine flows more deeper than Marilyn's nose
I'm a O.D 'til I'm in peace like Anna Nicole
Hov!

It begins to tell 'round midnight, 'round midnight
I do pretty well till after sundown
At suppertime I'm feelin' sad
But it really gets bad 'round midnight

Memories always start 'round midnight, 'round midnight
I haven't got the heart to stand those memories
So when, (when), when my heart is still with you
Yes old midnight knows it, too

Alone tonight
Ooh oh, ooh oh oh oh ...
For 'round midnight, when it comes around

So let our heart take wing, 'round midnight, 'round midnight
Let the angels sing for your returning
Till our love is safe and sound
And old midnight comes around

Cause I'm feelin' sad
And it really gets bad
'Round midnight, 'round midnight

There's a saying old
Says that love is blind
Still we're often told
Seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek
A certain lad
I've had in mind

Looking everywhere
Haven't found him yet
He's the big affair
I cannot forget
Only man I ever think
Of with regret

I'd like
To add his inital
To my monogram
Tell me
Where is the shepherd
For this lost lamb?

There's a somebody
I'm longin' to see
I hope that he turns
Out to be
Someone to watch over me

I'm a little lamb
Who's lost in the wood
I know I could
Always be good
To one
Who'll watch over me

Although he may
Not be the man some
Girls think
Of as handsome
To my heart
He'll carry the key

Won't you tell him please
To put on some speed
Follow my lead
Oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me

Now, he may not be
The man some girls think of as handsome
But to my heart, you carry the key
Oooh

Won't you tell him please
To put on some speed
Follow my lead
Oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me
Someone to watch over me

If my man was fighting
Some unholy war
I would be behind him
Straight shook up beside him
With strength he didn't know
It's you I'm fighting for
He can't lose with me in tow
I refuse to let him go
At his side and drunk on pride
We wait for the blow
We put it in writing
But who you writing for
Just us on kitchen floor
Justice done
Reciting my stomach standing still
Like you're reading my will
He still stands in spite of what his scars say
And I'll battle 'til this bitter finale
Just me, my dignity and this guitar case
Yes my man is fighting some unholy war
And I will stand beside you
And who you dying for
B - I would have died too
I'd have liked too
If my man was fighting
Some unholy war

[Verse 1]
You should be stronger than me
You been here 7 years longer than me
Don't you know you supposed to be the man
Not pale in comparison to who you think I am
You always wanna talk it through - I don't care!
I always have to comfort you when I'm there
But that's what I need you to do - stroke my hair!

[Chorus]
Cause' I've forgotten all of young love's joy
Feel like a lady, and you my lady boy

[Verse 2]
You should be stronger than me
But instead you're longer than frozen turkey
Why'd you always put me in control?
All I need is for my man to live up to his role
Always wanna talk it through - I'm OK
Always have to comfort you every day
But that's what I need you to do - are you gay?

[Chorus]
Cause' I've forgotten all of young love's joy
Feel like a lady, and you my lady boy

[Verse 3]
He said "the respect I made you earn
Thought you had so many lessons to learnt"
I said "You don't know what love is - get a grip!"
Sounds as if you're reading from some other tired script
I'm not gonna meet your mother anytime
I just wanna grip your body over mine
Please tell me why you think that's a crime

I've forgotten all of young love's joy
Feel like a lady, and you my lady boy

Your neighbours were screaming
I don't have a key for downstairs
So I punched all the buzzers, hoping you wouldn't be there
And now my head's hurting
You say I always get my own way
But you were in the shower when I got there, I'd have wanted to stay, but I got nothing to say

[Bridge]
Cos you were so beautiful before today
But then I heard what you got to say...man that was ugly

The Moschino bra you bought me last Christmas
Put it in the box, put it in the box
Frank's in there, I don't care
Put it in the box, put it in the box
Just take it
Take the box

Take the box

I came home this evening and nothing felt like how it should be
I feel like writing you a letter, but that's not me...you know me
Feel so fucking angry, don't wanna be reminded of you
But when I left my shit in your kitchen, I said goodbye to your bedroom
It smelled of you
Mr. False Pretence, you don't make sense
I just don't know you
But you make me cry, where's my kiss goodbye?
I think I love you!

Put it in the box, put it in the box
Just take it, take the box, take the box

I came home this evening and nothing felt like how it should be
I feel like writing you a letter but that's not me, you know me
Feel so fucking angry, don't wanna be reminded of you
But when I left my shit in your kitchen,I said goodbye to your bedroom
And smelled of you

Mr. False Pretense, you don't make sense, I just don't know you
But you make me cry, where's my kiss goodbye? I think I love you

The Moschino bra you bought me last Christmas
Put it in the box, put it in the box
Frank's in there I don't care
Put it in the box, put it in the box
Now take it, take the box
Just take it, take it take the box
And now just take the box, take the box

<EOS>

Your neighbors were screaming, I don't have a key for downstairs
So I punched all the buzzers, hoping you wouldn't be there
And now my head's hurting, you say I always get my own way
But you were in the shower when I got there, and I'd have wanted to stay
But I got nothing to say

You were so beautiful before today
And then I heard what you say, man, that was ugly

The Moschino bra you bought me last Christmas
Put it in the box, put it in the box
Frank's in there, and I don't care
Put it in the box, put it in the box
Just take it, take the box, take the box

Did you say I've got a lot to learn?
Well babe, don't think I'm trying not to learn
Since this is the perfect spot to learn
Go on, teach me tonight

Starting with the ABC of it
Right down to the XYZ of it
Help me solve the mystery of it
Go on, teach me tonight

The sky's a blackboard high above you
If a shooting star goes by
I'll use that star to write "I love you"
A thousand times across the sky

One thing isn't very clear, my love
Should the teacher stand so near, my love?
Graduation's almost here, my love
Teach me tonight

I'll use that star to write "I love you"
A thousand times across the sky

One thing isn't very clear, my love
Should the teacher stand so near, my love?
Graduation's almost here, my love
Oh oh teach me...
Oh oh
Teach me tonight

[Verse 1]
All I can ever be to you
Is a darkness that we knew
And this regret I've got accustomed to
Once it was so right
When we were at our height
Waiting for you in the hotel at night
I knew I hadn't met my match
But every moment we could snatch
I don't know why I got so attached
It's my responsibility
And you don't owe nothing to me
But to walk away I have no capacity

[Chorus]
He walks away
The sun goes down
He takes the day but I'm grown
And in your way, in this blue shade
My tears dry on their own

[Verse 2]
I don't understand
Why do I stress the man
When there's so many bigger things at hand
We could a never had it all
We had to hit a wall
So this is inevitable withdrawal
Even if I stop wanting you
A perspective pushes through
I'll be some next man's other woman soon
I can not play myself again
I should just be my own best friend
Not fuck myself in the head with stupid men

[Chorus]
He walks away
The sun goes down
He takes the day but I'm grown
And in your way, in this blue shade
My tears dry on their own

[Bridge]
So we are history
Your shadow covers me
The sky above ablaze
That only lovers see

[Chorus]
He walks away
The sun goes down
He takes the day but I'm grown
And in your way, in this blue shade
My tears dry on their own

[Verse 3]
I wish I could say no regrets
And no emotional debts
Cause as we kiss goodbye the sun sets
So we are history
The shadow covers me
The sky above ablaze that only lovers see

[Chorus]
He walks away
The sun goes down
He takes the day but I'm grown
And in your way, in this blue shade
My tears dry on their own
He walks away
The sun goes down
He takes the day but I'm grown
And in your way, in this blue shade
My tears dry on their own
He walks away
The sun goes down
He takes the day but I'm grown
And in your way, in this blue shade
My tears dry on their own

There I go, there I go, there I go, there I go
Pretty baby you are the soul, snaps my control
Such a funny thing but everytime your near me
I never can behave
You give me a smile and I'm wrapped up in your magic
There's music all around me
Crazy music, music that keeps calling me so
Baby close to you, turns me into your slave
Come on and do with me any little thing that you want to
Anything, baby just let me get next to you

So am I insane or do I really see heaven in your eyes?
Bright as stars that shine up above you
In the clear blue sky, how I worry bout you
Just can't live my life without you
Baby come here, don't have no fear
Oh, is there wonder why
I'm really feeling in the mood for love

So tell me why, stop to think about this weather, my dear
This little dream might fade away
There I go talking out of my head again baby won't you
Come and put our two hearts together
That would make me strong and brave
Oh, when we are one, I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid
If there's a cloud up above us
Go on and let in rain
I'm sure our love together would endure a hurricane
Oh my baby won't you please let me love you
And get a release from this awful misery

What is all this talk about loving me, my sweet
I am not afraid, not anymore, not like before
Don't you understand me, now baby please
Pull yourself together, do it very soon
My heart's on fire, come on and take
I'll be what you make me, my darling

Oh baby, you make me feel so good
Let me take you by the hand
Come let us visit out there
In that new promised land

Maybe there we can find
A good place to keep a lovin' state of mind
I'm so tired of being without it
And never knew what love was all about
James Moody would you come on hit me
You can blow now if you want to, I'm through

[Verse 1]
Tall and tan and young and lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking and
When she passes each one she passes
Goes laboo-du-di-daa
When she walks, it's just like a samba
That swings so cool and sways so gentle
That when she passes, each one she passes
Goes laboo-du-di-daa

[Chorus]
Oh, how I watch her so sadly
How can I tell her I love her
Yes, I would give my heart gladly
But each day, when she walks to the sea
She looks straight ahead, not at me

[Verse 2]
Tall and tan and young and lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking

The girl, the girl, the girl
From Ipanema, from Ipanema

Oh, how I want her so badly
How, how can I tell her I love her
Yes, I would give my heart gladly

She looks straight ahead, not at me

That when she passes, each one she passes
Goes daboo-du-daa

Oh, but I watch her so sadly
How can I tell her I love her
Yes, I would give my heart gladly
But each day as she walks to the sea
She looks straight ahead, not at me

Tall and tan and young and lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking now
When she passes
I go di-di-do-di... from Ipanema...

Yea I want her so badly
How, how can I tell her I love her
Yes, I would give my heart gladly
But each day when she walks to the sea
She looks straight ahead, not at me

Tall and tan and young and lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking
And when she passes, I smile
But she doesn't see
She ain't looking at me

[Verse]
There is no greater love
Than what I feel for you
No sweeter song, no heart so true
There is no greater thrill
Than what you bring to me
No sweeter song
Than what you sing, sing to me
You are the sweetest thing
I have ever known
And to think that you are mine alone (you are mine alone)
There is no greater love
In all the world, it's true
No greater love
Than what I feel for you

To Know Him Is To Love Him

[Bridge - Amy Winehouse]
To know, know, know him
Is to love, love, love him
Just to see that smile
Makes my life worthwhile
To know, know, know him
Is to love, love, love him
And I do, I do, I do

[Verse 1- Amy Winehouse]
Oh, I'll be good to him
I'll bring joy to him
Oh, everyone says
There'll come a day
When I'll walk alongside of him
To know him is to love, love, love him
And I do, I really do, I do

[Bridge - Amy Winehouse]
Why can't he see
How blind can he be
Someday he'll see
That he was meant for me

[Outro - Amy Winehouse]
Oh oh, to know, know, know him
Is to love, love, love him
Just to see that smile
Oh, it makes my life worthwhile
To know, know, know him
Is to love, love, love him
And I do, I really do, and I do

With my Trilby cap my ensembles locked

[Verse 1]
Save a whole floor for my haute couture
When I got more shoes than Carrie Bradshaw
More bags than I can store... I want more, more, more

Ballet shoes in satin, canvas, and leather
Dig out my Denny Mac whatever the weather
Rock the red shoes forever shoo-be-doo, shoo-be-doo... mm
I want a wardrobe bigger than Nairobi
Take four hours to cloth me... hold me down
When I pass the top shop in town
Cause you carrying my extra bags around... Yeh

[Chorus]

Lay you out and lace up Jimmy Choos
Pair of shoes for all my jazzes and blues
Every fabric of the hue
I'm dressing dependent on how I feels
Right like a mini Imelda on wheels
Bamboo Gucci heels... bamboo Gucci heels
An ashtray rests on my cigarette pants
Spend it if I get the chance
Shop alone, gather bags wherever I roam
Cause I'm always unpacking when I get home

[Chorus]

I'm gonna pay up Cartier
With Agent Provocateur strip poker chips
Moschino underwear with hot pink lips... undoing zips

[Chorus]x3

<EOS>

[Chorus 1]
Well sometimes I go out by myself
And I look across the water
And I think of all the things, what you're doing
And in my head I paint a picture

[Chorus 2]
Since I've come on home
Well my body's been a mess
And I've missed your ginger hair
And the way you like to dress
Won't you come on over
Stop making a fool out of me
Why don't you come on over, Valerie?
Valerie
Valerie
Valerie

[Verse]
Did you have to go to jail
Put your house on up for sale, did you get a good lawyer?
I hope you didn't catch a ten
I hope you find the right man who'll fix it for you
And are you shopping anywhere
Changed the color of your hair, are you busy?
And did you have to pay that fine
That you were dodging all the time, are you still dizzy?

[Chorus 2]
Since I've come on home
Well my body's been a mess
And I've missed your ginger hair

[Verse 1]
It's okay in the day I'm staying busy
Tied up enough so I don't have to wonder where is he
Got so sick of crying
So just lately
When I catch myself I do a 180
I stay up clean the house
At least I'm not drinking
Run around just so I don't have to think about thinking
That silent sense of content
That everyone gets
Just disappears soon as the sun sets

[Chorus]
He gets fierce in my dreams seizing my guts
He floors me with dread
Soaked to soul he swims in my eyes by the bed
Pour myself over him
Moon spilling in
And I wake up alone

[Verse 2]
Regardless my heart
I'd rather be restless
The second I stop the sleep catches up and I'm breathless
This ache in my chest
As my day is done now
The dark covers me and I cannot run now
My blood running cold
I stand before him
It's all I can do to assure him
When he comes to me
I drip for him tonight
Drowning in me we bathe under blue light

[Chorus]
His face in my dreams seizes my guts
He floods me with dread
Soaked in soul
He swims in my eyes by the bed
Pour myself over him
Moon spilling in

[Outro]
And I wake up alone
And I wake up alone
And I wake up alone
And I wake up alone

I'd rather be restless

Hello Friend
How has it been ?
Ain't it wonderful, you've got a friend?
Cause though we've changed in our endeavors
I found we still have some things in common

Now ain't it strange, and wonderful?
That we're still friends, we're still friends

Through our heart, we've never parted
Even through our living
We're friends, as friends, friendships all
And the way we are when we're together

[Verse 1]
Understand, once he was a family man
So surely I would never, ever go through it first hand
Emulate all the shit my mother hates
I can't help but demonstrate my Freudian fate
My alibi for taking your guy
History repeats itself, it fails to die
And animal aggression is my downfall
I don't care about what you got, I want it all

[Chorus]
It's bricked up in my head, It's shoved under my bed
And I question myself again "What is it 'bout men?"
My destructive side has grown a mile wide
And I question myself again "What is it 'bout men?"
What is it 'bout men?

[Verse 2]
I'm nurturing, I just wanna do my thing
And I'll take the wrong man as naturally as I sing
And I'll save my tears for uncovering my fears
Our behavioral patterns that stick over the years

[Chorus]
It's bricked up in my head, It's shoved under my bed
And I question myself again "What is it 'bout men?"

What is it 'bout men?

It's bricked up in my head, It's shoved under my bed

[Verse 1]
I can see you ahead of me
But I'm not always forward thinking
I'll tell you what you want to hear
It depends on what I've been drinking
Because everything I do or say
Makes it hard for you to stay
We both know, What it is
Nowadays we talk too much
Like you're forgetting all the good shit
You decide whats wrong with me
I always used to let you say
But now I like to think out loud
You're running with some different crowd
We both know, What it is

[Chorus]
I don't know you anymore, supposed to be the man, that I live my life by
And you're attitudes become a bore
And I'm so tired, I can't even cry, cry

[Verse 2]
Mr Ultra Sensitive
I'll never let myself forget you
Messed each other up you know
So I'm sorry if I upset you
Tomorrow is another day so I'll call you cause that's OK
We both know, What it is

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Relationship doesn't remain
We resonate on different planes
I could cut you down again
If you was like all other men
If you were like all other men
I know that I could shut you down again
But my friend, but my friend

[Chorus][x2]

I always used to let you say it

But now I like to think out loud
You're runnin' with some different crowd
We both know what it is

I don't know you anymore
Supposed to be the man
That I live my life by
And your attitude become a bore
And I'm so tired I can't even cry, cry

Mr. ultra sensitive

I can't even cry, I can't even cry

Relationship dust and remains
We resonate on different flames
I could cut you down again
If you was like all other men
If you were like all other men
I know that I could shut you down again
But my friend, but my friend

I don't know you anymore
Supposed to be the man
That I live my life by, I live my life
Your attitude's become a bore
And I'm so tired I can't even cry

I don't know you anymore
Supposed to be the man
That I live my life by
Oh, your attitude become a bore
And I'm so tired I can't even cry

[Verse 1]
Waitress on skates in training
They dart to call it dreaming
Images present themselves to me
Seeds are ripe for reaping
I continue sleeping
You're everything you ever wanted to be
And nothing here is changing

No messy rearranging
Cause every set of [?] stays the same
Sinatra's always singing
And you do all the clinging
And someone else accepts my place

[Chorus]
Whatever my imagination throws
So rugged, growing rose
When my eyes do close
When my eyes do close
When they close

[Verse 2]
Turn and face my ceiling
Deep in all the feeling
Inhibitions turn to dust and fly away
Stop my eyelids flickering
With your petty bickering
But this time I say
What I've got to say
I hear my girl Dinah's playing
And tree branches start swaying

Run over and sit right by the roof
And I see the leaves are growing
Little birds are showing
Reach out a hand
Invite him to the thrown

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Nothing such a scrutiny
Avoiding all the mutiny
You are loving beautifully
And it's fragrant beautifully
Colorful and monochrome
Amy Winehouse alone
Far away from ringing phone at home
I turn to stone, turn to stone
And all the thoughts are static
Yeah, my singing is automatic
And I wish that I could sell it in my every urge you
Tell her
Cause I can sense no danger
I am the lone ranger
Through the desert in a yellow caddy
With a black haired blue eyed stranger
White dress outside drying
I've been fear for flying
I overtake Montgomery in skills, yeah
Never been more daring
Kitten heels I'm wearing
Reality a blow that sometimes kills

When I drop it lyrically
Words evolve generically
And I don't ever need to collapse in tears
And I could curse your timing
Thunderously miming
And I feel young beyond my years

[Chorus]

<EOS>

[Verse]
Tonight you're mine completely
You give your love so sweetly
Tonight the light of love is in your eyes
Will you still love me tomorrow?
Is this a lasting treasure
Or just a moment's pleasure?
Can I believe the magic of your sighs?
Will you still love me tomorrow?
Tonight with words unspoken
And you say that I'm the only one, the only one, yeah
But will my heart be broken
When the night meets the morning star?
I'd like to know that your love
Is love I can be sure of
So tell me now, cause I won't ask again
Will you still love me tomorrow?
Will you still love me tomorrow?
Yeah

<EOS>

[Verse 1]
You always hurt the ones you love
That's why I had to twist the blade
Goodbyes ain't my forte
Hat tipped, you go your way
You'll never meet a girl like me
I'll never meet a boy like you
No-one who knew what we went through
Would designate us someone new

[Verse 2]
As black as Fat Kams' market trade
White as the rap sheet of a dove
This is the way you switched the blade
You always hurt the ones you love

<EOS>

[Verse 1]
Meet you downstairs, in the bar and hurt
Your rolled up sleeves and your skull t-shirt
You say "What did you do with him today?"
And sniffed me out like I was Tanqueray
Cause you're my fella, my guy
Hand me your Stella and fly
By the time I'm out the door
You're ten men down like Roger Moore

[Chorus]
I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told you I was trouble
You know that I'm no good

[Verse 2]
Upstairs in bed with my ex boy
He's in the place but I can't get joy
Thinking on you in the final throes
This is when my buzzer goes
Run out to meet you, chips and pitta
You say "When we married" 'cause you're not bitter
"There'll be none of him no more,"
I cried for you on the kitchen floor

[Chorus]
I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told you I was trouble
You know that I'm no good

[Verse 3]
Sweet reunion, Jamaica and Spain
We're like how we were again
I'm in the tub, You on the seat

Yeah, you know that I'm no good

<EOS>

Meet you downstairs in the bar and heard
Your rolled up sleeves and your skull t-shirt
You say what did you do with him today?
And sniff me out like I was Tanqueray

Cause you're my fella, my guy
Hand me your stella and fly
By the time I'm out the door
You're ten men down like Roger Moore

I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told ya, I was trouble
You know that I'm no good

Upstairs in bed, with my ex boy
He's in the place, but I can't get joy
Thinking of you in the final throes, this is when my buzzer goes

Run out to meet you, chips and bitter
You say we'll marry 'cause you're not bitter
There'll be none of him no more
I cried for you on the kitchen floor

I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told ya, I was trouble
You know that I'm no good

Sweet reunion, Jamaica and Spain
We're like how we were again
I'm in the tub you on the seat
Lick your lips as I soak my feet

Then you notice little carpet burn
My stomach drop yeah and my guts churn
You shrug and it's the worst
To truly stuck the knife in first

I cheated myself like I knew I would
I told ya I was trouble, you know that I'm no good
I cheated myself, like I knew I would
I told ya I was trouble, you know that I'm no good

[Chorus 1]
You're wondering now, what to do, now you know this is the end
You're wondering how, you will pay, for the way you misbehaved

[Chorus 2]
First time I swallowed, now you're on your own
I won't return, forever you will wait

[Bridge]
You're wondering now, what to do, now you know this is the end

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1]
You're wondering now, what to do, now you know this is the end
You're wondering how, you will pay, for the way you misbehaved
You're wondering now, what to do, now you know this is the end
You're wondering how, you will pay, for the way you misbehaved

<EOS>

[Verse 1]
Lent you Outsidaz and my new Badu
While you were thinking I didn't have a clue
Tough to sort files with your voice in my head
So then I bribed you downstairs with a Marlboro Red, uh huh

And now I feel so small discovering you knew
How much more torture would you have put me through?
You probably saw me laughing at all your jokes
Or how I did not mind when you stole all my smokes, yeah

[Chorus]
And although my pride is not easy to disturb, yeah
You sent me flying when you kicked me to the curb
With your battered jeans and your Beasties tee
Now I can't work like this, with you next to me

[Verse 2]
And although he's nothing in the scheme of my years
It just serves to bludgeon my futile tears
And I'm not use to this, no no, I observe yeah, I don't chase
But now I'm stuck with consequences, thrust in my face, yeah
And the melodramas of my day deliver blows
And that surpass your rejection, it just goes to show
A simple attraction that reflects right back to me
So I'm not as into you as I appear to be

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
His message was brutal but the delivery was kind
Maybe if I get this down, I'll get it off my mind, yeah
Oh it serves to condition me and smoothen my kinks
Despite my frustration for the way that he thinks
And I knew the truth, when it came, would be to that effect
At least you're attracted to me which I did not expect
Didn't think you'd get my number down as such
But I never hated myself, for my age so much, yeah

[Chorus x2]
